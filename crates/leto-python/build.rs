//! macOS link behavior for the `leto_python` Python extension cdylib.
//!
//! The cdylib is a Python extension module: it must never link a Python
//! interpreter library, because the interpreter that loads it supplies the
//! Python symbols at load time. On Apple's linker that contract is spelled
//! `-undefined dynamic_lookup`. Leaving the behavior unpinned (dependent on
//! pyo3's feature resolution and the build environment) risks the same
//! intermittent `Undefined symbols: _PyBaseObject_Type` link failure the
//! consus cdylib exhibited on its macOS CI runner, where this repo's CI
//! never exercises the link — the macOS link of this crate happens only in
//! the release wheel build, where a flake is most expensive.
//!
//! Emitting the flag from here pins it for every build path that links this
//! cdylib. It is emitted only for Apple targets, so other platforms and
//! dependency builds are untouched.
